Slides
======

The slides are in the `slides` directory.

From there you can do
```
./build.sh
```
to build them, provided you have git and the Haskell Platform installed.

This will install pandoc, which might take a little while.

Code
====

- The basic code is in `code/free`.
- The code using monad transformers is in `code/freet`.
- The networking code will follow shortly if I manage to shake off holiday-mode.
